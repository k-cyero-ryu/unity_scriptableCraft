# ⚔️ Forgebound: Parametric Crafting Demo

**Forgebound** is a playable video game demo that explores a next-generation crafting system where every weapon is **parametrically generated**. This goes beyond visual customization — every crafted item is unique in both **form and function**.

This project is a **conceptual sandbox** for reimagining item crafting as an **artistic design process**, while preserving gameplay balance and mechanics diversity. Future expansions will include **armors, accessories**, and **modular enhancements**.

## 🎮 What Makes Forgebound Unique?

> 🔧 "Don't just craft a sword — forge an identity."

- **Parametric Weapon Generation**  
  Each weapon is generated from a set of modular parameters — length, weight, blade curve, material blend, energy core shape, etc.

- **Form Affects Function**  
  - Curved blades swing faster but with less reach  
  - Double-edged weapons hit in both directions but are heavier  
  - Shaft materials affect stamina cost and durability  
  - Material fusion creates elemental or mechanical effects

- **Infinite Combinations**  
  Thanks to procedural generation and layered modifiers, players can create **hundreds of thousands** of functionally and visually distinct weapons.

- **Visual and Physics Fidelity**  
  Geometry adapts to the crafting parameters in real-time. Models, animations, and physics simulations all reflect the crafted design.

## 🧪 Current Demo Scope

- Weapon Crafting UI (modular & responsive)
- Real-time preview and stats feedback
- In-engine physics test area (swing, throw, impact)
- Basic AI dummies for testing
- Data visualization of weapon parameters (coming soon)

## 💡 Inspiration

This demo is inspired by the idea that **customization should be more than cosmetic**. By giving weight to geometry, materials, and structure, we aim to turn crafting into a **creative experience with mechanical consequence**.

## 🧠 Final Thought

> "Crafting isn’t a menu. It’s a canvas."
